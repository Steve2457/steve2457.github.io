Hi üëã I am a third-year undergraduate at the School of Information Science and Engineering ([Chongxin College](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738)), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yinwei Wei](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/weiyinwei1/zh_CN/index.htm). I have a solid foundation in mathematics, excel at learning new concepts, and am self-motivated with strong execution skills.

My research interests lie in developing more capable and general AI agents. Here are some core problems I‚Äôm thinking about:
- How can generative world models provide agents with a deeper understanding of causality and dynamics?
- In what ways does integrating multiple modalities enable richer perception and interaction in large models?
- How can we build intelligent systems that learn, reason, and act effectively in complex, real-world environments?

I am passionate about advancing AI towards greater generality and real-world applicability.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
